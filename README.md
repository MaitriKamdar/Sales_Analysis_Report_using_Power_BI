# Sales_Analysis_Report_using_Power_BI

🚀 Excited to share one of the key milestones from my learning journey in Data Analytics!

I recently built a Sales Analysis Report in Power BI, where I explored:

 📊 Sales performance across regions, categories, and segments
 
 📈 Trends over the years (2019–2022) by quarter & region
 
 🗂️ Insights into top-performing sub-categories like Phones & Chairs
 
 💡 KPIs such as Total Sales (2.3M), Quantity (38K), Profit (286K), and more

This hands-on project helped me strengthen my skills in:

 ✅ Data visualization with Power BI
 
 ✅ Creating interactive dashboards
 
 ✅ Storytelling with data-driven insights

I’m continuously expanding my expertise in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python—with the goal of transitioning into a Data Analyst role.
Here’s a quick snapshot from my report 👇

Grateful for the progress so far, and excited to keep learning, building, and growing! 🌟
